## 🧪 About the Experiment

This project is based on an experiment I conducted in Professor Liad Modrik's lab, supervised by PhD student Maor Shreiber.

The goal of the experiment was to examine whether **working memory (WM)** can operate **without conscious awareness** of a stimulus. Participants were briefly shown a **Gabor stimulus** (a visual stimulus), followed by a mask, and then asked to judge the direction of a second Gabor patch relative to the first.

We measured:
- **Perceptual Awareness** using the **PAS (Perceptual Awareness Scale)** — rated 1 to 4
- **WM performance** — accuracy in the main task
- **Stimulus contrast** — how visible the initial stimulus was

## 🔍 Research Questions

1. Can working memory function without conscious awareness?  
2. Does stimulus contrast affect awareness?  
3. Is there an interaction between contrast and WM in predicting awareness?
